# HigherOrLower
This is a short and simple python game that chooses a number from 1-100 randomly and you must guess it within 10 tries.


HigherOrLower (HOL) started as a LUA script when I was learning how to make Gmod addons. Now, it has evolved into a python script that is more efficient and has a visual version with a window and not just a terminal script.



KEEP IN MIND:

      The visual version of HOL REQUIRES the wxPython package and all of its dependicies!!!
